## Introduction

This repository represents the finance calculator capstone project in the _HyperionDev Data Science (Fundamentals)_ course. The main script can be found [here](https://github.com/ianhaggerty/finance-calculator-capstone/blob/master/finance_calculators.py).

## Math Explainer

Please see [here](https://bit.ly/4aTOhvN) for an exploration of the mathematics involved.

There is further work the be done regarding [changing the interval](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/continuously_compound.asp) to which the interest is calculated.

I'm planning to do a video tutorial for those not so acquainted with financial mathematics.
